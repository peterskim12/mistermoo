I've obviously been bad at keeping this blog up to date so why not create another one? :) I like to keep my personal and work lives separate so I created a new blog at [peterskim.org](http://peterskim.org) to write about tech stuff.

It's really easy to post stuff on LinkedIn but it's also becomes content that you don't really own anymore if it's on another domain. Even posts on your employer's blog don't really feel like your own--there will always be doubts about the author's genuine opinions when it's on a corporate blog.

Especially in the age of AI, I think writing is very important. Sure, you can probably always get something that's better written by asking Gemini to do it, but writing isn't just about the end product. Taking the time to write something is a learning process in itself.
